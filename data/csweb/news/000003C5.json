    "content": "The Microsoft Research Asia Fellowship Program would like to express its sincere gratitude for your continuing support of our collaborative efforts, in particular the fellowship program. This year, 62 distinguished Ph.D. candidates from 35 leading research universities/institutions were nominated for fellowships. Applicants included candidates from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. \r\n\r\nEach candidate’s credentials and research projects were thoroughly evaluated by a review committee. This year, 28 students have been awarded fellowships.  We are very pleased to inform you that Mira Lee, from your department, is among those selected. A cash award of US$6,000 will be provided to support the fellow‘s research and academic endeavors. Moreover, Microsoft Research Asia (Beijing) would like to provide internships opportunities. If students wish to take the internship opportunity, MSR Asia will discuss specific arrangements with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the nine years since the MSRA Fellowship Program started, more than two hundred and twenty PhD candidates from fifty universities/institutions have served as fellows. The program has been highly successful in fostering advances and collaboration in computer science and research. We look forward to your continued support in the years to come. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n2007 MSRA Fellowship Program",
