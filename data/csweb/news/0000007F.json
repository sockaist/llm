    "content": "KAIST faculty member Joseph Seering has won a Best Paper Award for his paper, \"Hate Raids on Twitch: Echoes of the Past, New Modalities, and Implications for Platform Governance\", co-authored with colleagues at Stanford University. The paper was presented at the ACM conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), which was held in Minneapolis, USA from October 14-18, 2023.\nThe Best Paper Award was granted to the top 1ï¼… of papers out of more than 1000 submitted papers from researchers around the world. The multi-stage selection process included feedback from double-blind peer reviews as well as a secondary review process from an awards committee.\nThe paper performs an analysis of large scale targeted bot attacks that occurred on the Twitch video livestreaming platform in summer and fall of 2021. It describes patterns of behavior involved in the attacks, considers potential motivations, and details how targeted users responded.\nProfessor Seering has previously received Best Paper and Honorable Mention awards for his publications at the ACM CSCW, CHI, and CHI Play conferences. His research focuses primarily on content moderation and online safety.",
