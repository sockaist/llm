    "content": "https://2023.emnlp.org/program/keynotes/\nJong Cheol Park, Professor of School of Computing at KAIST, will deliver a Keynote Speech entitled \"Human-Centric Natural Language Processing\" at EMNLP 2023 in Singapore as follows.\nIn keeping up with the three pillars of natural language processing, ever-changing principles and techniques, emerging domains of application and related resources, and people with various needs for language support, our research team has paid particular attention to the third pillar with a special focus on human-centric diversity and minority issues, including children, experts in biology and medicine, deaf people, and people with different challenges to language use. In this talk, I wish to share our achievements along the way, recently leading to a flurry of pleasant results that make use of deep learning techniques and large language models. I conclude the talk with a cautious prognosis about what might lie beyond large language models that loom over much of what we do at the moment and may hamper diversity to a worrisome degree and even humanity in hindsight.",
