However, these attacks often suffer from low success rates against unknown black-box models, diminishing their viability in real-world usages.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method to boost the attack transferability from a white-box surrogate model to black-box target models. We perturb images on their attention space, attacking universal characteristics shared by different models and thus boosting transferability. Different from previous gradient-based methods that easily overfit to most vulnerable features unique to the surrogate model, we apply diversity regularization that guides our attack to explore more diverse features to perturb, decreasing the overfitting issue of the attack. We optimize these objectives using a generator. Extensive experiments on the existing benchmarks show that our attack outperforms the prior transfer-based black-box attacks in terms of transferability, thanks to the attention guidance and diversity regularization.\n수상을 축하드립니다.",
