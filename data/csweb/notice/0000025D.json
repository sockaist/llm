Standard security services required in such group settings (such \r\nas confidentiality, integrity and authentication) can be efficiently \r\nachieved if all group members share a secret key. A group key agreement \r\nprotocol (GKA) provide a technique for any set of participating players to \r\ncollaboratively establish a shared key.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we tackle two challenging issues in GKA: robustness \r\nand privacy-preserving authentication. Robustness improves performance by \r\nguaranteeing completion of GKA protocols despite participating player or \r\ncommunication failures. Affiliation-hiding authenticated GKA (AH-AGKA) \r\nprevents from man-in-the-middle-attacks by authenticating players in a \r\nprivacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\nWe propose a two-round group key agreement protocol, which offers a natural \r\ntrade-off between message size and the desired level of fault-tolerance. We \r\ndemonstrate that in a realistic setting of random player faults, the new \r\nprotocol has logarithmic-sized messages and expected round complexity close \r\nto two. We prove the security of the proposed protocols under the standard \r\ncryptographic assumptions.\r\n\r\nWe present the formal definition of the affiliation-hiding GKA in a standard \r\nPKI model with re-usable certificates. The model includes strong security \r\nproperties, called perfect forward secrecy (PFS) and linkable \r\naffiliation-hiding (LAH) - that an key agreement protocol might provide in \r\nthe face of player corruptions and session compromises. We construct two \r\nvariants of optimal-cost AH-AGKA protocols, which satisfy PFS and LAH \r\nnotions under the standard cryptographic assumptions in the random oracle \r\nmodel. The protocol yields minimal costs: three rounds of interaction \r\nmatches the round complexity of non-private PFS authenticated GKA and its \r\ncomputation costs are comparable to the cost of unauthenticated GKA.\r\n\r\n학과사무실 이윤정 드림",
