KAIST CS 891 Computer Security as a Social Science January 4-20, 2010 INSTRUCTORS Stuart Schechter (Microsoft Research, Ph.D. Harvard University) Jaeyeon Jung (Intel Labs Seattle, Ph.D. MIT) LOGISTICS KAIST *SEOUL* Campus in Dogok-dong, Classroom C2 (room #111) January 4, 7, 11, 13, 18, & 20 from 2:30pm to 5:00pm (Mondays and Wednesdays) COURSE DESCRIPTION Many of the biggest threats facing computer systems today exploit faulty assumptions made by engineers about how users will behave to protect themselves, their data, and the systems themselves. No real systems will be secure unless those who design it, purchase it, deploy it, and use it have the knowledge and incentives to keep it secure. We will examine information security and privacy as it relates to human behavior, using tools from economics, psychology and the social science. The readings have been selected to provide a wide cross-section of work in these areas. They have also been selected to include works that are both groundbreaking and entertaining. PREREQUISITES A computer science background is not required.  Students with backgrounds in Psychology or Economics are particularly encouraged to attend. Fluent English is not a requirement, but students must be willing to read papers written in English and to try to use the language in discussions and a presentation.
