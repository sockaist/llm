However, there has been a consistent lower growth rate of data access speed compared to that of computational processing speed. Because of this widening gap, it is still not possible to interactively perform various geometric applications such as rendering of or collision detection between massive models on commodity hardware.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present two orthogonal approaches--multi-resolution and cache-coherent layout techniques--to improve the performance of a wide variety of geometric applications. First, I will present novel multi-resolution techniques that reduce the amount of data necessary for performing geometric methods within a geometric error bound. Second, I will propose novel cache-coherent layouts that improve the cache utilization of runtime geometric applications. I have applied these two techniques into rendering, collision detection, and iso-surface extractions and, thereby, have been able to achieve significant performance improvement.\r\n\r\nI will show live demonstrations of view-dependent rendering and collision detection between massive models consisting of tens of millions of triangles on a laptop during the talk. Also, I will discuss practical and theoretical aspects of multi-resolution and cache-coherent layout techniques in the context of various geometric applications. Finally, I will pose ideas for challenging future work.\r\n\r\n\r\n* 관심있는 학생 여러분의 많은 참석바랍니다.",
