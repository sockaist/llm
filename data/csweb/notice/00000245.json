While a great deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention and detection of phishing emails and phishing websites, little research has been done in the area of training users to recognize these attacks. As part of his Ph.D. thesis work, Ponnurangam Kumarauguru (PK) has developed an email-based anti-phishing education system called PhishGuru. PhishGuru is a system in which training messages are designed to look like phishing messages. When users “fall” for these training messages, PhishGuru takes advantage of the “teachable moment” and immediately teaches users how to avoid falling for real scams in future. PK has applied learning science instructional principles in the design of PhishGuru. PK has contributed in both developing the right content and right delivery channel to present the training material to users. In this talk, PK will discuss the challenges for end user security education and approaches to make it work. PK will present the results of PhishGuru user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness, both in the laboratory and in the field. Results suggest that, while automated detection systems should be used as the first line of defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary approach to help people better recognize fraudulent emails and websites. PK will also briefly discuss the impacts that his research has had in the real-world. PhishGuru is also currently being commercialized by Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. 학과사무실 드림",
