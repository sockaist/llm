Rapid Growth in the Amount of Multimedia UCC\r\n  2. User Participation in Web 2.0 & its Effect on the Amount of Multimedia UCC\r\n  3. Need for Efficient Multimedia Data Search\r\n  4.

Related Research at Cambridge Univ.\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThe volume of available multimedia data across the internet has grown rapidly, \r\nbecause recent advances in mobile devices and high speed internet have enabled \r\nusers to easily create their own contents, called UCC, and disseminate them through \r\nthe internet. The amount of multimedia UCC will become more prevalent after mobile \r\nhigh speed internet, such as HSDPA, and internet television, called IP-TV, becomes \r\nmore popular, as thousands of people will create and upload all kinds of videos; from \r\ncasual to the carefully constructed, anywhere and anytime. As the size of UCC grows \r\norganically by user participation and while much of it is not well organised, the initiative \r\nto the data on Web 2.0 belongs to the owners of platforms where the user can easily \r\nfind out the data that they want, not to data owners. In other words, the core competency \r\non Web 2.0 comes from the way in which an efficient data search can harness collective \r\nintelligence. This presentation describes the research objective for efficient multimedia \r\ndata search for UCC, which aims to find automatic ways of indexing, categorising, and \r\nsearching large volumes of multimedia data using speech and dialogue understanding.  \r\nRelated research conducted at Univ. of Cambridge will be presented.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Words: Multimedia Data Search, User Created Contents (UCC), Web 2.0\r\n\r\n* 관심있는 학생 여러분의 많은 참석바랍니다",
