Movement of data, not arithmetic or control logic, is the factor limiting cost, performance, size, and power in these systems. Historically used only in high-end supercomputers and telecom switches, interconnection networks are now found in systems of all sizes and all types - from large supercomputers to small embedded systems-on-a-chip.  In this talk, I will describe how technology trends impact the design of interconnection networks in two different applications – in large-scale, multicomputer systems and the on-chip network used to interconnect the many-cores together.\r\n\r\nMotivated by the increasing pin bandwidth over the past twenty years, I will describe how the additional bandwidth can be effectively utilized by creating high-radix routers with large number of skinny ports instead of low-radix routers with fat ports. The use of high-radix routers leads to lower cost and better performance but using high-radix routers in the network presents many difficult challenges.  In this talk, I will address the topology aspect of high-radix networks and present the flattened butterfly and the dragonfly topology.  I will also describe the Cray BlackWidow network which is one of the first networks that exploits the benefits of high-radix routers.\r\n\r\nAs the number of cores increases in future many-core processors to efficiently use the increasing number of transistors, the on-chip network will be critical in achieving scalability of future many-core architectures.  I will discuss how on-chip networks can also exploit high-radix routers and describe the mapping of the flattened butterfly topology for on-chip networks.  In addition, I will present current and future research interests which focuses on interconnect-centric architecture – prioritizing communication and on-chip networks in the design of future many-core processors as well as systems-on-a-chip.\r\n\r\n학과사무실 드림",
