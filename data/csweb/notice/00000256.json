The auxiliary video is temporally \r\nsharper but at a lower resolution, while the lower-frame-rate video has higher spatial resolution but is susceptible to motion blur. \r\nOur approach uses the data from these two video streams to reduce spatially-varying motion blur in the high-resolution camera with a \r\ntechnique that combines both deconvolution and super-resolution.\r\n\r\nThe second half introduces a technique to reduce texture distortion that arises from constrained texture mapping. Constrained parameterization \r\nis an effective way to establish texture coordinates between a 3D surface and an existing image but results in noticeable texture distortion \r\nwhen the 3D geometry is mismatched to highly textured image regions. I will discuss a technique to reducethis distortion by expanding image \r\nregions via texture synthesis to better fit the 3D geometry. The result is a new amended texture that maintains the essence of the input texture \r\nimage but exhibits significantly less distortion when mapped onto the 3D model.\r\n\r\n학과사무실 드림",
