No real systems will be secure unless those who design it, purchase it, deploy it, and use it have the knowledge and incentives to keep it secure. We will examine information security and privacy as it relates to human behavior, using tools from economics, psychology and the social science. The readings have been selected to provide a wide cross-section of work in these areas. They have also been selected to include works that are both groundbreaking and entertaining. PREREQUISITES A computer science background is not required.  Students with backgrounds in Psychology or Economics are particularly encouraged to attend. Fluent English is not a requirement, but students must be willing to read papers written in English and to try to use the language in discussions and a presentation.
