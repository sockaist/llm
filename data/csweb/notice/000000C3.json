    "content": "IBM Research-Austin has multiple openings for summer interns in three areas: container technologies for cloud environments, large-scale data center networking, and the challenges of developing a data/insights marketplace. Interns will be paired with a mentor to identify specific problems to attack with the goal of generating both interesting research results and a publication in a top tier research venue. Candidates should be graduate students in Computer Science, Electrical/Computer Engineering, or related field, preferably pursuing a PhD and having prior research experience. INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANDIDATES: If you are interested in any of the positions described below, please BOTH apply online at https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/job_summary.jsp?job_id=RES-0714483 AND email a copy of your resume/cv to the individual listed as the primary contact for the relevant research area. DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL. CLOUD CONTAINERS: Container technologies are emerging as alternatives to virtual machines for quick service deployment (and take-down) in PaaS clouds. We are investigating cloud infrastructures that exploit containers to improve performance and enable faster deployment, while retaining the benefits of both bare metal servers and virtual machines. We are seeking candidates with strong implementation skills and interest in containers, operating systems, and similar topics to help us develop container technologies that support performance isolation, usage accounting, partitioning of accelerator resources, and large-scale deployment and management of container-based frameworks. Interested parties should send a resume to Wes Felter ( wmf＠us.ibm.com ), indicating your interest in the Cloud research project. DATA CENTER NETWORKING: Our lab is driving in the design, implementation, and evaluation of IBM's next-generation cloud network. We are seeking candidates with strong implementation skills and interests in network architecture, software-defined networking, network virtualization, network-aware workload scheduling, and/or network functions virtualization. Typically, interns in our group are afforded great flexibility and have published in SIGCOMM, CoNext, INFOCOMM and HotSDN. Interested parties should send a resume to Eric Rozner ( erozner＠us.ibm.com ). INSIGHTS MARKETPLACE: Industries are being applying transformed by data analytics, but where do enterprises find 3rd party data to provide context to and fill gaps in their internal data? Recently marketplaces for data and data services have started to form around structured data, e.g., quandl.com , enigma.io , and Azure Data Marketplace. Since data marketplaces are still evolving, there are many research questions to address. How should providers bring their data to a marketplace? What is the right granularity for consumption? How are various data types and formats supported? How can related data sets be identified? Which provider and consumer services should be offered to enhance and simplify the marketplace experience? What is the underlying architecture to support these services in a reliable and high-performance manner? We will investigate these questions in the context of developing a prototype cloud-based marketplace for open data and services. If you are interested, please send Charles Lefurgy ( lefurgy＠us.ibm.com ) a copy of your resume indicating your interest in the Insights Marketplace project.",
