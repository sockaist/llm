The term “wired society” in the past is now changing to “semantically-wired society”. In the very coming years, the internet use cost will be cheaper and cheaper, and a variety of convergence services and the content providers would provide a new business model. The new “service” creation is considered important to enforce the investment toward the network infrastructure and related semantic technology. \r\n\r\nThe 8th AEARU Web Technology and Computer Science Workshop provides a forum for researchers from the member universities of the Association of East Asian Research Universities (AEARU) to present their most recent research results on web technology and computer science. The objective is to identify potential research areas, exchange ideas on research and education, and discuss the means for productive collaborations in the field of web technology and computer science. The workshop also welcomes researchers not belonging to the member universities to join and participate in the discussion.\r\n\r\nImportant Dates\r\n\r\nTitle and Abstract Submission Due: 3/14/2008 (Friday) \r\nFull Paper Submission Due: 3/21/2008 (Friday) \r\nPaper Acceptance Notification: 3/25/2008 (Tuesday) \r\nWorkshop Date: 4/11/2008 (Friday)  \r\n\r\nPaper Submission Guidelines\r\nTitle and Abstract: 1 page, include contact address & phone number\r\nFull Paper: LNCS style, maximum 8 pages, send PDF file as attachment\r\nPlease send your submissions to moonzoo at cs.kaist.ac.kr \r\nCall for papers download here( pdf version )\r\n\r\nHomepage\r\nhttp://cs.kaist.ac.kr/AEARU/\r\n\r\nFurther details will be announced at the workshop homepage.",
