Unfortunately, such painstaking work and advanced skill is out of reach for casual photographers. In addition, for professional photographers, it is important to improve workflow efficiency. I demonstrate that computation can allow users to achieve particular viewpoint and appearance with ease and speed. We analyze and transfer properties of a model photo to a new photo. In particular, we transfer the viewpoint of a reference photo to enable rephotography. In addition, we transfer photographic appearance from a model photo to a new input photo. In this talk, I will present two projects that transfer photographic viewpoint and appearance using model photographs and one project that magnifies existing defocus given a single photo. First, we address the challenge of viewpoint matching for rephotography. Our interactive, computer-vision-based technique helps users match the viewpoint of a reference photograph at capture time. Next, we focus on the tonal aspects of photographic look using post-processing. Users just need to provide a pair of photos, an input and a model, and our technique automatically transfers the look from the model to the input. Finally, we magnify defocus given a single image. We analyze the existing defocus in the input image and increase the amount of defocus present in out-of focus regions.",
