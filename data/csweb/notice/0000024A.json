In this talk, we provide a number of new analytic results characterizing the performance limits of GMS. We first provide an equivalent characterization of the efficiency ratio of GMS through a topological property called the local-pooling factor of the network graph. then develop an iterative procedure to estimate the local-pooling factor under a large class of network topologies and interference models. We use these results to study the worst-case efficiency ratio of GMS on two classes of network topologies. We show how these results can be applied to tree networks to prove that GMS achieves the full capacity region in tree networks under the K-hop interference model. Then, we show that the worst-case efficiency ratio of GMS in geometric unit-disc graphs is between 1/6 and 1/3 학과사무실 드림",
