Speaker: Chan Young Park (Ph.D. candidate, Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University) Title: Socioculturally Aware Language Technologies Time: Friday, June 9, 2023, 14:00 KST Place: Information & Electronics Building (E3-1) Room 4420 Ann Young-Kyung Seminar Room Language: English ZOOM Meeting: uilab.kr/chanyoungpark-230609 Here is the abstract of the talk and the speaker's biography. Abstract Society and culture play a significant role in shaping an individual's identity, and language serves as a tool for cultural and psychological expression, reflecting one's sociocultural background. However, current language technologies often overlook sociocultural contexts, resulting in less effective and potentially biased models. Similarly, social science and sociolinguistics have yet to fully embrace state-of-the-art NLP models, relying instead on relatively primitive techniques like lexicon-based approaches and simple unsupervised methods such as topic models. In this talk, I present my work that bridges the gap between NLP and sociocultural knowledge, demonstrating their mutual benefits. Part 1 highlights improvements in NLP models achieved through the incorporation of sociocultural context, with a focus on community-sensitive norm violation detection. Additionally, I introduce ongoing work on developing community-specific language models. Part 2 explores leveraging advanced language technologies to study social bias and information campaigns, addressing associated obstacles and providing practical solutions. Biography Chan Young Park is a final-year PhD candidate in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Professor Yulia Tsvetkov. She earned her MS and BS from Yonsei University, Korea, and is currently a visiting PhD student at the University of Washington. Her research focuses on the intersection of natural language processing, computational social science, and AI ethics, specifically enhancing language technologies' effectiveness, fairness, and adaptability for diverse populations. She is passionate about using NLP for social good and is dedicated to developing fair and accessible language technologies. Her work has been published in top conferences and journals, including PNAS, ACL, EMNLP, WWW, and ICWSM. She was selected as a University of Chicago Rising Stars in Data Science and received Wikimedia Foundation Research Award of the Year 2023 for studying social biases on Wikipedia. Chan Young is also a recipient of the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies PhD fellowship. location: Information & Electronics Building (E3-1) Room 4420 Ann Young-Kyung Seminar Room tag:csweb.calendar",
