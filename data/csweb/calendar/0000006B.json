Abstract Deep learning dominates not only contemporary research in machine learning but also the industry in almost every sector since its regained prominence in 2012. It continues to expand its abilities into new areas by achieving a human-comparable intelligence. Yet it is still isolated within the computing box. In this talk, I will explain what Digital Twin, Embodied AI, and Metaverse are and how AI is trying to interact with the physical world. I will then discuss what are the major challenges in bridging them. As an underlying technology for Digital Twin and Embodied AI, a simulation platform will be presented. Later, I will share cases of commercialized products and work-in-progress research where the AI meets the real physical world via simulation. Bio Unkyu Park is the head of the Simulation Lab at Samsung Research. He is working on a simulation platform that provides simulation-driven product development for various products; home and industrial robots, autonomous vehicles, digital humans, and AR/VR. His current research is in simulation, with strong connections to artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and robotics. Before joining Samsung Research, he worked as a senior engineer at Hyundai Motor Company. At Hyundai, he brought the latest IT technologies into vehicles; mirroring a mobile screen on the vehicle, driving a vehicle via virtual reality interface, and a quadcopter drone as a vehicle companion, and more. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Southern California, advised by John Heidemann and M.S. from the University of Pennsylvania.
