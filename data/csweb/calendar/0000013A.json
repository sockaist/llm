Recent advancements in deep learning and neural representations have revolutionized how we capture and interpret 3D environments, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic scene understanding even from sparse, incomplete, or ambiguous inputs. In this talk, I will present our recent work on neural 3D reconstruction and learning-based 3D scene understanding. Specifically, I will discuss our efforts in multi-view surface reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction for novel view synthesis, and reconstruction under occlusions and sparse-view settings. Additionally, I will highlight our research on open-world and vocabulary-free 3D scene understanding, pushing the boundaries of semantic comprehension in complex environments. Bio: Dr. Gim Hee Lee is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS), where he leads the Computer Vision and Robotic Perception Laboratory. Prior to joining NUS, he was a researcher at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), USA. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. He has served or will serve as an Area Chair for major computer vision and machine learning conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, NeurIPS, etc. He was part of the organizing committee as the Program Chair for 3DV 2022 and Demo Chair for CVPR 2023, and he is organizing 3DV 2025 in Singapore as the General Chair. He is a recipient the Singapore NRF Investigatorship, Class of 2024. His research interests include 3D computer vision, machine learning and robotics. location: E3-1 1501 (Offline) tag:csweb.calendar",
