By using laser interferometry to measure 3-D refractive index (RI) distribution, 3D images of live cells without any molecular labeling can be obtained with high spatial resolution. Furthermore, QPI images can be analyzed to provide quantitative information of a single cell, including cell volume, dry mass, and protein concentration. In this seminar, we will discuss about the studies in quantitative cell biology by imaging the live cells with unprecedented correlative and quantitative bioimaging capabilities. We will also introduce representative studies which integrate artificial intelligent (AI) technologies for elucidating the characteristics based on the HT images and their quantitative information of individual mammalian cells.

Her team is running numerous research projects to explore biological applications using 3D quantitative phase imaging. Her main research interest is the quantitative analysis of individual cells and its organelle dynamics. She also has been managing the projects in product development including research instrument, in vitro diagnostic medical device, and 3D image analysis software. Dr. Lee received her Ph.D. degree from POSTECH in 2013 majoring Cellular Systems Biology. Until her post-doctoral training, she performed comparative studies of protein trafficking machineries to elucidate the evolution of organellar protein delivery mechanism in eukaryotic cells. From 2014 to 2017, She was a senior scientist in Division of Research Strategy Planning and Division of Forensic Genetics, National Forensic Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, Republic of Korea.
