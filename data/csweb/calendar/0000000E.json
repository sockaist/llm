Abstract : Having a digital map allows the digital twin of a city. I building and maintaining a map, both extrovert and introvert sensors are exploited to infer the robot and map. The extrovert sensors including cameras and LiDARs have been widely utilized, dominantly leading recent autonomous navigation research. Unfortunately, these sensors are strongly dependent on the environment that encompasses both structural and temporal variance (e.g., illumination and structural variance). Without resilient sensor exploitation, robust navigation is never achievable yielding even catastrophic results. This talk will introduce robust sensor fusion and control and its application to perceptual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) covering from underwater to urban environment. Bio : Ayoung Kim is the associate professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering with joint affiliation at KI robotics and school of computing, KAIST. She received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan (UM), Ann Arbor, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. She also worked as a post-doctoral researcher in naval architecture and marine engineering, UM in 2013 before works at ETRI as a senior researcher. Her research interests include visual simultaneous localization and mapping, navigation. Language : English Zoom url : https://kaist.zoom.us/j/743014746 location: Online(zoom) tag:csweb.calendar",
