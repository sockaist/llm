In this talk, I show that high-speed I/O is also important for LLC management in addition to CPU cores. This is because of an Intel architectural innovation – Data Direct I/O (DDIO) – that directly injects the inbound I/O traffic to (part of) the LLC instead of the main memory. I summarize two problems caused by DDIO and show that (1) the default DDIO configuration may not always achieve optimal performance, (2) DDIO can decrease the performance of non-I/O workloads that share LLC with it by as high as 32％. I then present, the first LLC management mechanism that treats the I/O as the first-class citizen. Currently, the implementation is adopted by Intel’s Resource Direct Technology (RDT). Bio: I am the W.J. ‘Jerry’ Sanders III – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Endowed Chair Professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and a fellow of both ACM and IEEE. From 2018 to 2020, as a Sr. Vice President at a major memory manufacturing company, I led the development of next-generation DRAM products, including the industry's first HBM-PIM that will play a significant role in shaping the future computing landscape. I have published more than 200 refereed articles to highly-selective conferences and journals in the field of computer architecture, digital circuit, and computer-aided design. The top three most frequently cited papers have more than 4500 citations and the total number of citations of all my papers exceeds 13000. I was a recipient of many awards, including the IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) Best Paper Award in 2003, NSF CAREER Award in 2010, ACM/IEEE Most Influential International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) Paper Award in 2017, and SIGMICRO 2021 Test of Time Awards in 2021. I am a hall of fame member of all three major computer architecture conferences, IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) , MICRO, and ISCA. I earned a PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Master and Bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. location: 정보전자공학동(E3-1) 4층 4443호 (오상수영상강의실) tag:csweb.calendar",
