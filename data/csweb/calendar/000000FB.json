To this end, we designed and built a custom multi-camera rig to densely capture walkable spaces in high fidelity and with multi-view high dynamic range images in unprecedented quality and density. To represent highly detailed scenes, we extend instant neural graphics primitives with a novel perceptual color space for learning accurate HDR appearance, and an efficient mip-mapping mechanism for level-of-detail rendering with anti-aliasing, while carefully optimizing the trade-off between quality and speed. Our multi-GPU renderer enables high-fidelity volume rendering of our neural radiance field model at the full VR resolution of dual 2K×2K at 36 Hz on our custom demo machine. We demonstrate the quality of our results on our challenging high-fidelity datasets, and compare our method and datasets to existing baselines. Speaker bio: Christian Richardt is a Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs Research in Pittsburgh, USA. He was previously a Reader and EPSRC-UKRI Innovation Fellow in the Visual Computing Group, the CAMERA Centre and REVEAL at the University of Bath. His research interests cover the fields of image processing, computer graphics and computer vision, and his research combines insights from vision, graphics and perception to reconstruct visual information from images and videos, to create high-quality visual experiences with a focus on 6-degree-of-freedom VR video. location: OSS Multimedia Room, Rm. 4443, E3-1, KAIST School of Computing tag:csweb.calendar",
