To tame the complexity, PALSware has been proposed as a middleware component that constructs a logically synchronous environment on top of physically asynchronous hardware and network systems. In this talk, I will present VeriPALS, a formally verified C implementation of PALSware, together with a verification framework for application systems on top of it. In the framework, we devised a method that lifts an arbitrary untimed program semantics (e.g., CompCert Clight) to a timed semantics. We also lift CompCert's proof to guarantee the correctness of distributed systems with compiled assembly programs. As a result, the framework provides an executable abstract system model, enabling efficient application system testing. Bio: Yoonseung Kim is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Seoul National University, Korea. His research interests lie in formally verifying real-time distributed systems by interactive theorem proving. He received Ph.D. in Computer Science at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Chung-Kil Hur in 2021, and B.S. in Computer Science/Mathematics at KAIST in 2013. location: https://meet.google.com/dkb-qqfd-npd tag:csweb.calendar",
