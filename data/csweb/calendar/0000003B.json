In addition to training accurate models, there is an urgent need to address model fairness, robustness, interpretability, and more. To this end, we propose two systems for tackling Responsible AI in different angles. FR-Train (ICML'20) is the first system to address both model fairness and robustness within the same model training. A key insight is that performing both operations together is more effective than sequential execution. FR-Train uses mutual information theory to guarantee fairness and robustness using adversarial training. A small clean validation set is used for robust training, which can be constructed using crowdsourcing and majority voting. Next, Slice Tuner (revision phase, SIGMOD'21) is the first system to propose actionable data acquisition feedback through model analysis for better accuracy and fairness (equal error rates). The key idea is to maintain learning curves of slices, which can be used to predict accuracies on those slices given more data. Slice Tuner then solves a convex optimization problem to determine the amount of data to acquire per slice. In addition, Slice Tuner solves the problems of unreliable learning curves and influences of acquiring data for one slice to others by iteratively and incrementally updating the learning curves. As a result, a model can obtain better accuracy and fairness compared to various baselines given a fixed budget for data acquisition. Bio : Steven Euijong Whang is a Kwon Oh-Hyun associate professor at the School of Electrical Engineering and Graduate School of AI, KAIST. His research interests are Big Data - AI Integration and Responsible AI. Previously he was a Research Scientist at Google Research from Dec. 2012 to Jan. 2018 and co-developed the data infrastructure of the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) machine learning platform. Steven received his Ph.D. in computer science in 2012 from Stanford University and his B.S. in computer science from KAIST in 2003. He received the Google AI Focused Research Award (2018), the first in Asia. Homepage: http://stevenwhang.com Language : English location: Online(zoom) tag:csweb.calendar",
