However, such interactions pose new challenges to traditional approaches to security and privacy. In this talk, I will present how I utilize sensor data to provide security and privacy protections for IoT/CPS scenarios, and further, introduce novel security threats arising from similar sensor data. Specifically, I will highlight some of our recent projects that leverage sensor data for attack and defense in various IoT applications. I will also introduce my future research directions such as identifying and defending against unforeseen security challenges from newer application domains including smart homes, buildings, and vehicles. Bio Jun Han is an Assistant Professor at Yonsei University with an appointment in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. He founded and directs the Cyber-Physical Systems and Security (CyPhy) Lab at Yonsei. Prior to joining Yonsei, he was at the National University of Singapore with an appointment in the Department of Computer Science, School of Computing. His research interests lie at the intersection of sensing systems and security, and focuses on utilizing contextual information for security applications in the Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. He publishes at top-tier venues across various research communities spanning security, sensing systems, and mobile computing (including S&P/Oakland, Usenix Security, CCS, MobiSys, SenSys, IPSN, and Ubicomp). He received his Ph.D. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University as a member of Mobile, Embedded, and Wireless (MEWS) Group. He received his M.S. and B.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering also at Carnegie Mellon University. Jun also worked as a software engineer at Samsung Electronics. location: https://kaist.zoom.us/j/9224054469?pwd=UkY2K0Z0c1pZS0ttUVdzc1BlYlVOdz09 tag:csweb.calendar",
