He obtained his PhD from Univ. of Cambridge in 2008 and Junior Research Fellowship (governing body) of Sidney Sussex College, Univ. of Cambridge for 2007-2010. His BSc and MSc are from KAIST. His research interests primarily lie in machine learning for 3D computer vision, including: articulated 3D hand pose estimation, face analysis and recognition by image sets and videos, 6D object pose estimation, active robot vision, activity recognition, object detection/tracking, which lead to novel active and interactive visual sensing. He has co-authored over 80 academic papers in top-tier conferences and journals in the field, and has co-organised series of HANDS workshops and 6D Object Pose workshops (in conjunction with CVPR/ICCV/ECCV). He was the general chair of BMVC17 in London, and is Associate Editor of Image and Vision Computing Journal, and IET Computer Vision. He regularly serves as an Area Chair for the major computer vision conferences. He received KUKA best service robotics paper award at ICRA 2014, and 2016 best paper award by the ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, and the best paper finalist at CVPR 2020, and his co-authored algorithm for face image retrieval is an international standard of MPEG-7 ISO/IEC. Abstract This talk presents some recent work from Computer Vision and Learning lab at KAIST/ICL. It addresses our study on understanding and simulating hand-object interaction. Data and annotations are lacking for 6D object pose and 3D hand pose estimation, in particular under hand-object interaction scenarios. We will discuss limitations and challenges for data augmentation, via 1) self-supervised learning by pose consistency, 2) an organized public challenge, HANDS 2019, measuring generalisation to unseen data, 3) weakly-supervised domain adaptation via GAN and mesh model, and 4) physics-based dexterous manipulations by residual reinforcement learning.
