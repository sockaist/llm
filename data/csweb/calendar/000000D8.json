In this paper, we achieve improved simple regret upper bounds for both data-rich (＄T＼ge n＄) and data-poor regime (＄T ＼le n＄) where ＄n＄ is the number of arms and ＄T＄ is the number of samples. At its heart is an improved analysis of the well-known Sequential Halving (SH) algorithm that bounds the probability of returning an arm whose mean reward is not within ＄＼epsilon＄ from the best (i.e., not ＄＼epsilon＄-good) for ＼textit{any} choice of ＄＼epsilon>0＄, although ＄＼epsilon＄ is not an input to SH. We show that this directly implies an optimal simple regret bound of ＄＼mathcal{O}(＼sqrt{n/T})＄. Furthermore, our upper bound gets smaller as a function of the number of ＄＼epsilon＄-good arms. This results in an accelerated rate for the ＄(＼epsilon,＼delta)＄-PAC criterion, which closes the gap between the upper and lower bounds in prior art. For the more challenging data-poor regime, we propose Bracketing SH (BSH) that enjoys the same improvement even without sampling each arm at least once. Our empirical study shows that BSH outperforms existing methods on real-world tasks. Bio: Kwang-Sung Jun is an assistant professor at the CS department, University of Arizona. His research interest is interactive machine learning with a focus on bandit problems, online learning, and confidence bounds. Before joining UA, he was a postdoc at Boston University with Dr. Francesco Orabona. Before then, he spent 9 years at University of Wisconsin-Madison for a PhD degree with Dr. Xiaojin (Jerry) Zhu and a postdoc with Drs. Robert Nowak, Rebecca Willett, and Stephen Wright location: Hybrid. N1-102 + https://kaist.zoom.us/my/juhokim tag:csweb.calendar",
