Abstract Advances in autonomy are enabling intelligent robotic systems to enter human-centric environments like factories, homes and workplaces. To be effective as a teammate, we expect robots to accomplish more than performing simplistic repetitive tasks; they must perceive, reason, perform semantic tasks in a human-like way. However, there exists a “semantic” gap between the human’s higher order understanding of the world and the low-level representation of the robot. In this talk, I will discuss how a robot can acquire grounded representations aligned with human notions as a step towards enabling natural human robot interaction and semantic task execution. First, I will address the problem of grounding natural language instructions in the context of the robot’s world model by leveraging visual-linguistic context accrued over time. Next, I will discuss how a robot can take introspective actions to infer the latent or “missing” aspects of its world model. Finally, I will share emerging work in learning common sense knowledge about the when symbolic actions are relevant for a task from human demonstrations; aiding plan synthesis for human-intended goals. Bio Rohan Paul is an Assistant Professor and Pankaj Gupta Young Faculty Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India. His research program is aimed towards capable service robots that can perform complex tasks along-side humans. Previously, he served as a Postdoctoral Associate at the Computer Science and AI Laboratory (CSAIL) at the MIT working with Prof. Nicholas Roy contributing towards programs funded by the RCTA, the Toyota Research Institute and the National Science Foundation. Rohan obtained a D.Phil. at the Oxford University advised by Prof. Paul Newman. Rohan obtained his B. Tech. and M.Tech. degrees at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.
