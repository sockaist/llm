He has been an assistant professor in the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University from 2015 to 2019 and then an associate professor in the Dept. of Artificial Intelligence at Korea University in 2019. He has been a research scientist at Georgia Tech from 2011 to 2015, where he received M.S in 2009 and Ph.D in 2013. His research areas include computer vision, natural language processing, and visual analytics. Abstract Due to the advancement of generative adversarial networks, image generation and translation techniques are being actively developed, inspiring and accelerating humans' creative activities. In the light of this research direction, this talk will present my recent work on image-to-image translation and its applications in automatic image colorization.
