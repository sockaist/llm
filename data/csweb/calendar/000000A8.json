These include fuzzing of operating system kernels and hypervisors, grammar-based fuzzing of complex interpreters, and fuzz testing of stateful systems. In addition, I will also talk about a method for efficient fuzzing using snapshots and our recent work on browser fuzzing. As part of this work, we have already found hundreds of software bugs, some of which are related to known programs and systems.I will conclude the talk with an outlook on challenges yet to be solved. Bio Prof. Thorsten Holz is a faculty member at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. His research interests include technical aspects of secure systems, with a specific focus on systems security. Thorsten received a Dipl.-Inform. degree in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University (2005) and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Mannheim (2009). Before joining CISPA in October 2021, he was a full professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. location: Zoom (Online) tag:csweb.calendar",
