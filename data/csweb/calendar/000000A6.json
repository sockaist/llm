An intermediate representation of a compiler is a language internally used to represent compiling programs. Unlike general-purpose languages, the primary goal of intermediate representation is to facilitate compiler optimizations. An adequately designed intermediate representation allows faster compilation, rich presentation of invariants from the source language, and less buggy compiler implementation. I will introduce the intermediate representations in modern compilers such as LLVM and MLIR in-depth and describe how they are used. Also, I will introduce a compiler for homomorphic encryption that CryptoLab is developing using MLIR. Homomorphic encryption is an encryption scheme that allows performing arbitrary operations on encrypted data. It is gaining a lot of attention from both industry and academia because it allows machine learning without concerns about data privacy. Since a typical application of homomorphic encryption consists of many loops on arrays, traditional compiler techniques can improve performance. I will introduce the compiler prototype and present its preliminary results.
