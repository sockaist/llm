As one of killer applications of cryptography selectively using one-way hash functions, digital signatures over elliptic curve and distributed consensus protocols, etc. to provide anonymous P2P digital cash, Satoshi Nakamoto suggested so-called Bitcoin cryptocurrency which initiatives an explosive application of block chain to many areas of ICT services for the purpose of keeping data to be once-recorded and permanent storage with 100％ correctly. Another breakthrough in the current computing power is expected to be an emergency of quantum computer in some decades. We have to rebuild the current cryptography to be resistant against quantum adversaries who exploit the quantum computer to break our secure systems.To prepare for Post-Quantum Cryptography(PQC), we need to know what and how NIST is now soliciting for new standard of PQCs all over the world. Finally, from all the lessons we learned so far, the challenges and issues for next-generation modern cryptography will be suggested for your contribution as computer scientists. The main goal of this talk is to learn that \"博古知今(來) : If you are well aware of the past, you can see the present (future).\" Bio Kwangjo Kim received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1980 and 1983, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan, in 1991. He worked at Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) from 1979 to 1997 as a head in coding section #1. He was a Visiting Professor with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge,MA, USA and the University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, in 2005 and the Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, Abu Dhabi, UAE, in 2012 and an Education Specialist with the Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia, in 2013. He is currently a Full Professor with the School of Computing and Graduate School of Information Security, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, the Korean representative to IFIP TC-11 and the honorable President of the Korea Institute of Information Security and Cryptography (KIISC). Prof. Kim served as a Board Member of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) from 2000 to 2004, the Chairperson of the Asiacrypt Steering Committee from 2005 to 2008 and the President of KIISC in 2009. He is a Fellow of IACR, a member of IEICE, IEEE, ACM, and a member of IACR Fellow Selection Committee. He serves an Editor-in-Chief of online journal Cryptography, an Editor of Journal of Mathematical Cryptology and an Associate Editor of IEEE Trans. on Dependable and Secure Computing. Moreover, Prof. Kim serves as General Chairs of Asiacrypt2020 and PQCrypto2021 which will be held at Daejeon, Korea in 2020 and 2021, respectively. His current research interests include the theory of cryptology, information security and their applications.
