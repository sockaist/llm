In particular, I will talk about GPU cluster management, machine learning training and inference systems, machine learning compilers and runtime systems, AutoML systems for hyper parameter optimization and neural architecture search. Then, I will present my group’s recent research on improving the performance, efficiency, and programmability of machine learning frameworks including Crane, Hippo, and EParallax. Bio Byung-Gon Chun is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Seoul National University (SNU). Chun is also an Associate Director at Artificial Intelligence Institute at SNU. Chun works on systems for machine learning and data processing. Chun was a Visiting Research Scientist at Facebook in 2016-2017. Before joining SNU, Chun was a Principal Scientist at Microsoft. Prior to that, Chun worked at Yahoo！ Research, Intel Research, and International Computer Science Institute. Chun holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, an M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University, and a B.S. and an M.S. from the Electronic Engineering Department at SNU. He has published papers in the premier conferences such as SOSP, OSDI, SIGMOD, VLDB, NSDI, SIGCOMM, EuroSys, ATC, FAST, NIPS, and MobiSys. He has also contributed actively to Apache open source projects. He is the recipient of the 2019 SNU Education Award, the 2018 Amazon Machine Learning Research Award, the 2017 Facebook Caffe2 Research Award, the 2017 Amazon Cloud Credits for Research Award, the 2015 Naver Young Faculty Award, and the 2014 Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship.
