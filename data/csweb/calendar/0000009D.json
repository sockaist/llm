Abstract Generative models that apply deep learning to the generation of contents such as images and sound are attracting attention. However, generative process using deep learning is a black box, which makes it difficult for humans to understand and control. In this talk, I will introduce methods for human intervention and control of such generative processes and other computer-assisted content generation. I will show examples in computer-aided design using physical simulation, generative models of images, 3D models, and acoustic signals. Bio Takeo Igarashi is a Professor of Computer Science Department at The University of Tokyo. His research interest is in user interfaces and interactive computer graphics. He has received several awards including the ACM SIGGRAPH 2006 Significant New Researcher Award, ACM CHI Academy award 2018, and the Asia Graphics 2020 Outstanding Technical Contributions Award. He served as a program co-chair for ACM UIST 2013, a conference co-chair for ACM UIST 2016, technical papers chair for SIGGRAPH ASIA 2018, and technical program co-chair for ACM CHI 2021.
