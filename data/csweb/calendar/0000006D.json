One of the astonishing properties of human intelligence is its versatility; a person can solve almost an infinite number of different problems by constantly acquiring the necessary knowledge and applying it to the newly faced problems. Arguably, this aspect of intelligence might be one of the essential components to truly see the unbounded potential similar to human intelligence from artificial intelligence. In this talk, I will share my perspective on how reinforcement learning, combined with automatic task discovery, can be used to improve the versatility of artificial intelligence. Bio Hyeonwoo Noh is a research scientist at OpenAI. He finished his Ph.D. at the Pohang University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Professor Suha Kwak and Professor Bohyung Han. He spent time at Google and DeepMind for a research internship, and spent time at the University of Southern California as a visiting researcher under the supervision of Professor Joseph Lim. He is interested in building machines that can solve a variety of emerging problems by constantly acquiring skills and learning to understand the problems. His research focuses on learning deep neural networks with a few general interfaces to solve a large number of problems.
