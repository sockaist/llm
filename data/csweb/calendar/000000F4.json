Please join us！ - Time: 11 am-noon, April 17 (Wed) - Location: N1 112 (Offline) - Language: English - Host: Juho Kim Title: Augmenting Routines with Wearable Displays Abstract: In today's digital landscape, computing has become an integral part of our daily routines, seamlessly intertwining with daily activities such as commuting. In this talk, I will present my research investigating how such computing experiences can be facilitated more seamlessly using wearable displays (smart glasses). I will discuss multiple projects that showcase how smart glasses can enable more seamless mobile computing (than phones) for a variety of tasks ranging from video learning to mindfulness practices, thereby providing insights into interface design for these emergent platforms. Bio: Ashwin Ram is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Synteraction lab (formerly NUS-HCI lab) led by Prof. Shengdong Zhao. He completed his PhD in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. Prior to this, he completed his Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering at NIT-Trichy, India. His research interests lie in the intersection of wearable computing, and Intelligent User Interfaces. His work has been published at top-tier HCI venues, such as ACM CHI, IMWUT, DIS, and MobileHCI. location: N1-112 (Offline) tag:csweb.calendar",
