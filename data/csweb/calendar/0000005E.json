Abstract Human motion understanding plays an important role in the development of intelligent systems. However, understanding the dynamics and uncertainty present in human motion comes with many challenges due to the many degrees of freedom in human bodies. Moreover, the multiple variety of human body shapes (e.g., skinny vs bulky) present an additional set of challenges due to shape constrains in the motion. Nevertheless, the existence of large datasets of human motion present us the opportunity take advantage of neural networks ability to identify and understand patterns within these datasets to come up with solutions to the many challenges in human motion modeling. Therefore, we have recently developed systems that can predict future motion or intent, are useful for understand body language, and control humanoid agents to perform specific commands. Applications of such systems range from video synthesis to animating and controlling simulated characters. In this talk, I will present works including video synthesis of future human motion, self-contact and mesh aware human motion retargetting, and humanoid character control of locomotion from which the latter has already been deployed in Adobe Aero. Bio Ruben is a Research Scientist at the Creative Intelligence Lab at Adobe. He received his PhD from the University of Michigan under the supervision of Professor Honglak Lee. Ruben’s main interests lie on human dynamics and character animation applied to control and editing. He is also interested in unsupervised learning, generative modeling of videos and images, model based reinforcement learning, and robotics.
