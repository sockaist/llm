Abstract Generative modeling is a frontier research topic in machine learning and AI. Despite the recent breakthrough in image and 3D shape synthesis in large scale benchmarks, it is still an open challenge for developing a general form of deep generative models on complex data (e.g., multi-modal and structured data) that can be directly applied to real-world tasks. The major challenges include high-dimensional representation space, entangled factors involved, and lack of existing deep modules for this data generation process. My talk starts with a brief introduction of the controllable representations for deep generative modeling in the context of text-to-image synthesis. The controllable representation is a set of factors as intermediate representations in the deep modules, and the representation power is demonstrated through conditional generation (e.g., control a partial set of units while keeping the rest unchanged). I will also explain its application in text-based image style transfer and image completion. For the rest of the talk, I will expand the discussion over the 3D domain and scene manipulation. Specifically, I will show how to apply such controllable and structured representations to a variety of related problems including (1) 3D object shape synthesis from image observations and part-structures, (2) image manipulation with semantic structures, and finally (3) geometrically consistent scene manipulation in a hierarchical framework. The case-by-case studies reveal not only the representation power but also a common aspect that the representations can be learned in unsupervised or weakly-supervised manner at scale. My talk ends with potential future directions that further advance the frontiers using deep controllable and structured modules, especially with multimodal data and on relational modeling.
