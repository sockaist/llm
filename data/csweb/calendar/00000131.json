Established through a unique public-private partnership involving the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Korea’s life sciences industry, RIGHT integrates R&D investment with access-focused strategies that span from innovation to global public procurement. Since its inception in 2018, RIGHT has committed over 107.5 billion KRW (~USD 80 million) across 69 grants targeting pandemic preparedness, neglected tropical diseases, enteric infections, antimicrobial resistance, and vaccine development. Its portfolio includes multiple late-stage clinical trials conducted in collaboration with global product development partners and institutions in over 22 countries. The Foundation’s funding approach emphasizes risk-balanced investments and supports capacity building through technology transfer and training in vaccine manufacturing. This presentation outlines RIGHT’s end-to-end strategy to facilitate the translation of Korean R&D capabilities into global public goods for low and middle income countries, with a particular focus on ensuring health equity in R&D and access pathways. It highlights the Foundation’s commitments to global access, including equitable pricing, supply guarantees, and licensing provisions. By aligning Korea’s scientific innovation with global health needs, RIGHT aims to shape a more equitable and resilient future for global public health. location: E3-1 1501 (Offline) tag:csweb.calendar",
