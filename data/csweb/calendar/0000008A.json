Based on this intuition, I will move on to introducing Rissanen data analysis [Perez, Kiela and Cho; 2021 ICML] and how it can be used for analyzing datasets. In the final part of the talk, I will demonstrate the difficulty of language model based zero/few-shot learning with some of the intuitions and tools from the first two parts of the talk. Bio Kyunghyun Cho is an associate professor of computer science and data science at New York University and CIFAR Fellow of Learning in Machines & Brains. He is also a senior director of frontier research at the Prescient Design team within Genentech Research & Early Development (gRED). He was a research scientist at Facebook AI Research from June 2017 to May 2020 and a postdoctoral fellow at University of Montreal until Summer 2015 under the supervision of Prof. Yoshua Bengio, after receiving PhD and MSc degrees from Aalto University April 2011 and April 2014, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. Juha Karhunen, Dr. Tapani Raiko and Dr. Alexander Ilin. He tries his best to find a balance among machine learning, natural language processing, and life, but almost always fails to do so.
