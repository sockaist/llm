Speaker: Roy Ka-Wei Lee Title: Online Trust & Safety Series: Countering Online Hate Speech with AI When: September 30th (Monday), 14:00 Where (offline): Information & Electronics Building (E3-1) Rm. 4443 (OSS Multimedia Clasroom) / 전산학동 (E3-1) 4443호 오상수영상강의실 Where (online): https://kaist.zoom.us/my/aliceatkaist Host: Alice Oh We are looking forward to seeing you at the talk！ Best regards, Haneul ==================== Here is the abstract of the talk and the speaker's biography. Abstract: As hate speech proliferates across digital platforms, the challenge of identifying and mitigating harmful content has become a critical issue for online trust and safety. In this talk, we explore how artificial intelligence (AI) is being leveraged to counter online hate speech effectively. We will examine the latest advancements in AI-driven content moderation, with a particular focus on detecting nuanced and context-dependent forms of hate, such as in memes and multilingual content. By addressing ethical challenges, including biases in AI models and the need for cultural sensitivity, this session will provide insights into how AI can balance the fine line between protecting free speech and fostering safer online communities.
