I, too, was increasingly drawn to healthcare applications during my graduate studies—particularly after beginning research in artificial intelligence in 2015, which unveiled vast opportunities for innovation in medicine. However, the realities of medical research often diverged from my initial expectations, ranging from challenges in accessing clinical data to the complexities of publishing in medical SCI journals. Driven by both curiosity and a sense of frustration, I joined Asan Medical Center, the largest hospital in Korea, immediately upon completing my Ph.D. Over the past five years—culminating in my current position as an assistant professor—I have participated in a range of research initiatives focused on the application of computational methods to medical data. In this talk, I will share key insights, challenges, and lessons learned from working at the interface of computer science and clinical research. I will also briefly discuss how Korea’s leading tertiary hospitals—commonly referred to as the “Big 5”—have come to view medical data research and artificial intelligence in the wake of the emergence of large language models (LLMs). I hope these reflections will offer valuable guidance to those seeking to translate computational techniques into meaningful contributions in healthcare. Bio: Tae Joon Jun is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Medical Informatics and Statistics at the University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center. He also serves as the director of the Computational Health Informatics Laboratory (CHILab). His research interests include artificial intelligence in medicine, healthcare informatics, and clinical epidemiology. He received his BSc. in Computer Science from Yonsei University and his MSc. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from KAIST. Prior to his current position, he was a principal research scientist at Asan Medical Center. location: N1 Building, 102 tag:csweb.calendar",
