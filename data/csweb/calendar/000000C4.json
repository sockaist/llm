Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and computer architecture have achieved human-scale speed and accuracy for classification tasks. However, current machines are far from capabilities such as metathinking, creativity, and empathy. In this lecture series, I contend that such a paradigm shift is possible only through a fundamental change in the state of artificial intelligence toward consciousness, similar to what took place in biological systems through the process of natural selection and evolution. First, I will present our most recent paper on AI consciousness proposing that is an emergent phenomenon that primordially appears when two machines co-create their own language through which they can recall and communicate their internal state of time-varying symbol manipulations. Since in our view, consciousness arises from the communication of inner states, it leads to empathy that can unlock unprecedented capabilities in machines. Such a fundamental shift requires architecting machines that can create languages while we currently need massive scale-out systems to just recognize and translate already excising pre-created languages. Clearly, we need to move beyond traditional approaches of computer architecture design to devise paradigms that break the current abstractions and deliver unparalleled performance and energy efficiency levels from edge to cloud. To that end, I will sketch out a journey that takes an algorithm-driven full-stack approach to deliver orders of magnitude gains by architecting both digital and analog programmable machines. Then, I will shift the focus towards the importance of data and its protection and highlight the role of hardware multi-tenancy in both democratizing artificial intelligence and its green development. I will also discuss our ongoing efforts to innovate holistic systems for neuroscience to enable brain-implantable devices that enhance memory in wet lab settings. In the end, I will outline future directions that aim at architecting next-generation green edge devices and datacenters with a data-centric approach that considers end-to-end application execution instead of just focusing on perception. 6. Speaker's Bio: Dr. Esmaeilzadeh was awarded early tenure at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where he is the inaugural holder of Halicioglu Chair in Computer Architecture with the rank of associate professor in Computer Science and Engineering. He is the CTO and Founder of Protopia AI that is named a 2022 Gartner Cool Vendor in AI Governance and Responsible AI. Prior to UCSD and Protopia, he was an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology from 2013 to 2017. There, he was the inaugural holder of the Catherine M. and James E. Allchin Early Career Professorship. Hadi is the founding director of the Alternative Computing Technologies (ACT) Lab, where his team is developing new technologies and cross-stack solutions to build the next generation computer systems. He is also the associate director of Center for Machine Integrated Compu=ng and Security (MICS) at UCSD. Dr. Esmaeilzadeh obtained his Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington in 2013 where his Ph.D. work received the 2013 William Chan Memorial Best Dissertation Award. Prof. Esmaeilzadeh received the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Architecture (TCCA) “Young Architect” Award in 2018 and was inducted to the ISCA Hall of Fame in the same year. He has received the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Award (2017), College of Computing Outstanding Junior Faculty Research Award (2017), Qualcomm Research Award (2020, 2017, and 2016), Google Research Faculty Award (2018, 2016 and 2014), Microsoft Research Award (2017 and 2016), and Lockheed Inspirational Young Faculty Award (2016). His teams were awarded the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2014 and 2018, one of his students was a Microsoft Research Fellow, and two of his students won the National Center for Women & IT (NCWIT) Collegiate Award in 2017 and 2020. Four of his undergraduate students have been awarded the Georgia Tech President’s Undergraduate Research Award (PURA). His research has been recognized by four Communications of the ACM Research Highlights, four IEEE Micro Top Picks, a nomination for Communications of the ACM Research Highlights, an honorable mention in IEEE Micro Top Picks, and a Distinguished Paper Award in HPCA 2016 and a Best Paper Nomination from DAC 2022. Hadi’s work on dark silicon has also been profiled in The New York Times.
