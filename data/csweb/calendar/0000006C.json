Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general-purpose machine learning framework, which considers an agent that makes sequential decisions in an environment to maximize its reward. Deep reinforcement learning approaches have made significant advances in the recent years by allowing the agent to learn a policy directly from raw observations. In this talk, I will first present how deep learning can be used to train RL agents to learn complex behaviors with several examples including AlphaStar, the first AI to defeat top professional players in the game of Starcraft 2. Finally, I will discuss how RL algorithms can be used to discover their own algorithms from data by introducing our recent attempt to meta-learn \"how to learn\" by interacting with environments, which can potentially open up entirely new approaches to RL by replacing hand-designed algorithms with meta-learned algorithms. Bio Junhyuk Oh is a senior research scientist at DeepMind. He received his Ph.D. from Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan in 2018, co-advised by Prof. Honglak Lee and Prof. Satinder Singh, and B.S. from Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University in 2014. His research focuses on deep reinforcement learning problems, which include generalization, planning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and meta-learning. Some of his work was featured at MIT Technology Review and Daily Mail. He served as a co-organizer of NIPS 2017 symposium on deep reinforcement learning, ICML 2018 workshop on exploration in reinforcement learning, and ICLR 2019 workshop on structures and priors in reinforcement learning.
