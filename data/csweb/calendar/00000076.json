While energy efficiency is important to reduce TCO (total cost of ownership), high performance is also essential to serve large models in production. Hyperscalers, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of programmability and flexibility for inference accelerators to track DNN progress[1]. In order to build a production accelerator for all these challenging requirements, instead of building a chip that is optimized for a specific model, the architecture should expose the raw ability to maximize parallelism and energy efficiency of DNN models to the software with well-defined abstraction. Software stack should also exploit every parallelism and energy efficiency for each operator and model. To accomplish such cross-layer optimizations within algorithm, architecture, and software, small and excellent teams must communicate deeply and closely, and design methodologies and the infrastructures must support these communication structures.
