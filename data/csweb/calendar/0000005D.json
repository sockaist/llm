Abstract Amortized inference refers to an inference method that learns from past experiences and uses them to accelerate future inference problems. The most popular example would be the inference network in a variational autoencoder, where a neural network mapping inputs to latent variables are trained to efficiently conduct inference for future inputs. This talk discusses the extension of the amortization for sets, unlike the previous amortized inference methods acting on fixed-dimensional vectors (or matrices or tensors). The amortized inference with sets is closely related to meta-learning or posterior inference for Bayesian models and requires special neural network architectures to implement them. The talk will describe how such networks can be constructed, and explain how such networks can be trained to amortized complex inference procedures such as clustering and generative modeling. Bio Dr. Juho Lee is an assistant professor in the graduate school of AI at KAIST. He received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from POSTECH and did his postdoc at the University of Oxford. After finishing his postdoc, he worked as a research scientist at AITRICS, an AI-based health-care startup. His research is mainly focused on Bayesian learning, ranging from Bayesian nonparametric models to Bayesian deep learning.
