Despite the large amount of information generated in social media platforms, understanding what is going on is not an easy task, even after the significant NLP progress in recent years. Its multilingual, dynamic, informal and multimodal nature, including the use of emojis, means that standard techniques are seldom optimal. In this talk, I will present advances on social media processing, and in particular the development of language models for Twitter (TweetEval for English and XLM-T for multiple languages), as well as unified benchmarks for standard NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis or offensive language identification. I will also explain our latest project related to the temporal aspect in social media, which is one of the most important NLP challenges nowadays. In this regard, I will present our recent TimeLMs initiative, with new insights and the commitment to share a new updated language model every three months. Finally, I will show a few use cases for these specialized models in social media, in particular for analysing political discourse. □ Bio: Jose Camacho-Collados is a Senior Lecturer and UKRI Future Leaders Fellow at Cardiff University, leading the Cardiff NLP group. Before joining Cardiff University, he completed his PhD in Sapienza University of Rome and was a Google AI PhD Fellow. Until recently, his research has focused on various semantics aspects with a distributional perspective. He is the co-author of the “Embeddings in Natural Language Processing\" book. More related to the topic of the talk, in the last few years he has been working in social media analysis and applications, developing NLP tools specifically targeted to this domain (particularly Twitter). □ Language : English location: Information & Electronics Building (E3-1) Room 4443 OSS Multimedia tag:csweb.calendar",
