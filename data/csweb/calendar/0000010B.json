These fuzz testing methods to find security vulnerabilities in software systems will be the main topic of this talk. At a technical level, fuzzing represents a biased random search with different machinery to control the bias. We discuss how the random search in fuzzing can be inspired by ideas from symbolic execution and model checking to go beyond conventional fuzzing methods, without sacrificing the efficiency of fuzzing. These observations have prompted our works in the area. By aligning thematically closer with symbolic execution, we can achieve directedness in the fuzzing search. By aligning closer with model checking, the technique can also find deeper bugs beyond simple crashes, such as violations of Linear-time Temporal Logic or LTL properties (covering the full LTL specification including liveness properties) which are out of the ability of conventional fuzzers. If time permits, we will conclude with our recent works on extending fuzzing to concurrent systems. Speaker Bio : Professor Abhik Roychoudhury is Provost's Chair Professor of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS), where he leads a research team on Trustworthy and Secure Software (TSS). His research group is known for contributions to automatic programming and automated program repair, as well as to fuzzing and symbolic execution. These have been honored with various awards including an International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) Most Influential Paper Award (Test-of-time award) for program repair, and IEEE New Directions Award 2022 for contributions to symbolic execution. Doctoral students graduated fom his research team have taken up faculty positions in many academic institutions including Max Planck Institute, University College London, University of Melbourne, NUS. He has served the research community in various capacities including as chair of the major conferences of the field, ICSE and FSE. Currently, he serves as chair of the FSE steering committee. He has been an Associate Editor of various journals, including currently serving in Communications of the ACM and TOSEM. Abhik received his PhD in Computer Science from State University of New York at Stony Brook in 2000. location: E3-1, Room4443 tag:csweb.calendar",
