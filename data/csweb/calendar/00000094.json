This has led to an increased interest and need for applying machine learning and artificial intelligence across the drug discovery pipeline from target identification to chemical lead selection and optimisation. It has also been demonstrated that drugs with human genetic validation data are more likely to succeed in the clinic. To address this, it is essential to unravel genetic networks to identify new or better targets for which the underlying mechanism is clear. Despite the significant advances in next generation sequencing technologies and evolving databases of patient cohorts, the sheer complexity of these datasets makes their integration and interrogation a daunting task. Through the development and application of cutting-edge computational approaches, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and mathematical modelling, to pharmacogenomics and drug discovery, we identify novel therapeutic targets, biomarkers and drug repositioning opportunities. In this talk I will focus on (1) systematic integration and harmonisation of biomedical big data (2) multi-omics disease association study and (3) network theory-based analysis of targetable pathway which have significant potential to provide unprecedented insights into vital biological processes and the control hubs that underpin disease. As an example of our research projects, I will present our data-driven computational analysis and simulation approaches that allowed us to identify drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. It is a timely research of general interest, which uses Computational Biology, Network-based algorithms and Artificial Neural Network to predict the repositioning of 200 already approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2. We are confident our approach has identified potential targets, since 20％ of these drugs are currently in COVID-19 clinical trials. We present the mechanism of action of the 200 drugs and demonstrate the efficacy of two of these (Proguanil and Sulfasalazine) in cellular assays. This huge dataset of SARS-CoV-2 induced pathways, already approved drugs to target them, along with their mechanism of action, defines a resource for repurposing of drugs against COVID-19, either in monotherapies or in combination therapy. location: Online(zoom) tag:csweb.calendar",
