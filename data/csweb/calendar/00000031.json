Nevertheless, ordinary users still suffer from a large number of undesired results such as false positives (spurious warnings) and false negatives (missed bugs) in practice. These problems mainly occur because traditional systems are 1) inflexible: the system hardly changes its strategies after deployment, 2) unidirectional: the system simply follows the designer's choices without interacting with the user, and 3) narrow-sighted: the system does not fully exploit a variety of available resources besides the input program text. In this talk, I will introduce a AI-based program analysis system that enables adaptive, interactive and continuous reasoning. The key idea is to seamlessly incorporate probabilistic reasoning to conventional logical reasoning. I will talk about how our system is able to enhance the quality of program analysis reports and reduce the user’s effort. Bio Kihong Heo is an Assistant Professor in the Graduate School of Information Security and the School of Computing at KAIST. His research aims to develop programming systems for safe, simple, and smart software. In particular, his work has focused on AI-based program reasoning systems, general-purpose program debloating systems, and scalable program synthesis systems. HIs research has been recognized by ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award at PLDI 2019, ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ICSE 2019 and Facebook’s Infer static analyzer. He obtained his Ph.D. and B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University. Prior to joining KAIST, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.
