He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019, and he received his B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering in 2015. He won 2016 SIGKDD Best Research Paper Award, and he has published over 35 refereed articles in major data mining and database venues, including KDD, ICDM, WWW, VLDB, and SIGMOD. His research interests include data mining, social network analysis, and scalable machine learning. Abstract Graphs are everywhere from online social networks to bipartite review graphs. Many of them are large and dynamic. Moreover, they are with extra information and thus naturally modeled as tensors (i.e., multi-dimensional arrays). Given large (e.g., terabytescale) dynamic graphs and tensors, how can we analyze their structure? How can we detect interesting anomalies? Lately, how can we model the behavior of the individuals in the data? In this talk, I will focus on these closely related questions, all of which are fundamental to understand large growing data on user behavior. First, for structure analysis, I will present our linear-time algorithm for lossless graph summarization, which successfully compresses a billion-scale web graph with an unprecedented compression rate of 0.7 bits per edge. Then, for anomaly detection, I will discuss our near-lineartime approximation algorithms that detect abnormally dense subgraphs and subtensors, which signal interesting anomalies, such as “follower-boosters” on Twitter and “edit wars” on Wikipedia. Next, regarding behavior modeling, I will introduce our game-theoretic models for the purchasing behavior of individuals on social networks. Lastly, I will conclude with my future vision on big data mining, covering upcoming challenges, new approaches, and real-world applications.
