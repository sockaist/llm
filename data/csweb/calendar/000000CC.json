However, despite these capabilities, these displays always have been relegated to the status of perpetually future technology due to several major challenges, such as large benchtop form factors and the fundamental trade-off between algorithm runtime and achieved image quality. In this talk, I will present co-design approaches of optics and algorithms in holographic near-eye displays that address these challenges. First, I will discuss a compact display system architecture with an eyeglasses-like form factor for virtual reality that can deliver full-color 3D holographic images using a 2.5mm thick optical stack. Next, I will introduce an algorithmic CGH framework that achieves unprecedented image fidelity and real-time framerates. Our framework comprises several parts, including a novel camera-in-the-loop optimization strategy that allows us to either optimize a hologram directly or train a parameterized model of the optical wave propagation and a neural network architecture that represents the first CGH algorithm capable of generating full-color high-quality holographic images at full-HD resolution in real-time. By incorporating AI advancements into conventional optics and photonics, we can open up new possibilities and enable high-fidelity imaging and display solutions. Bio: Suyeon Choi is a PhD student at Stanford Computational Imaging Lab, advised by Professor Gordon Wetzstein. His research interests are centered on co-designing optical systems and algorithms, focusing on developing holographic display systems that incorporate machine learning for next-generation virtual and augmented reality displays. His work is supported by a Meta Research PhD Fellowship, a Kwanjeong Scholarship, a Korean Government Scholarship, and a GPU gift from NVIDIA. Previously, he received his Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, completed his undergraduate studies at Seoul National University as a recipient of The Presidential Science Scholarship, and got a silver medal at the International Physics Olympiad. location: Lecture room: OSS Multimedia Room, Rm. 4443, E3-1, KAIST School of Computing tag:csweb.calendar",
