Title : Unleashing the potential of Knowledge Extractions for Cyber Security Abstract : We live in a world where anyone can easily retrieve desired information through the use of search engines, which gather and index the collective content from many billions of web-based sources from around the world. Prominent search engines perform these massively scalable feats of data indexing through the use of general- purpose knowledge bases (KBs). In fact, the rise of large-scale KBs can be observed in other systems, ranging from social network services to artificial intelligence applications, and continue to show great value in many domains. In this talk, we explore the design of a cyber-security knowledge-acquisition service to assist in the timeliness and scalability with which cyber-security professionals, novice users, and expert systems can compile a situational awareness of their threat landscape. Furthermore, we explore the potential of exploiting knowledge bases for cyber-security by actually presenting the design and prototype implementation of one such system. This talk describes the end-to-end process used to construct a cyber-security KB, and proposed both knowledge maintenance and usage strategies. Furthermore, we are looking forward to making our KB available to the public by releasing open APIs, and at the time of writing have produced a continually growing KB that currently holds over 79 million facts. Bio : Seungwon Shin received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A&M University. He has spent nine years at industry, where he devised several mission critical networking systems. He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST. His research interests span the areas of SDN security, Cyber Threat Intelligence, and system security. Language : Korean location: KAIST. E3-1. 4443 tag:csweb.calendar",
