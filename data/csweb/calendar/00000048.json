He received his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from KAIST in 1998, 2000, and 2006, respectively. He worked in the data mining area at UIUC from 2007 to 2009 and developed a part of the commercial DBMS engines at the IBM Almaden RC from 2009 to 2011. He was an assistant / associate / tenured associate professor in Information and Communication Engineering at DGIST from 2011 to 2020. He also was a director of Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Extreme Exploitation of Dark Data (EEDD) from 2018 to 2020 and an associate vice president for Information and Library Services of DGIST from 2019 to 2020. His research interests include database systems, data mining / machine learning, and bioinformatics. Abstract Fatal RNA viruses such as MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 have recently emerged around the world. Rapid and reliable detection of viruses is essential for accurate diagnosis of human infections and effective responses to global outbreaks. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used for rapid virus identification due to its low cost and high sensitivity and specificity, as well as the ubiquitous availability of the necessary reagents and equipment. Designing high-quality primers is challenging due to a bunch of complex filtering constraints and homology tests. Many tools, websites, and databases exist or have been proposed to aid in designing primers for PCR test. However, all of them do not guarantee to find the best valid primers for detecting the RNA viruses precisely due to their heuristic approach. In this talk, I will present a big data technology for designing high-quality primers to detect such RNA viruses precisely. MRPrimer is a Map-Reduce algorithm that can design all valid primers for detecting a specific sequence among a given species’ sequences in an exhaustive way. MRPrimerW is a web-based online processing tool that can design the best primers like a Google search. MRPrimerV is the world’s first database that compiles the valid primers for detecting all known 1818 RNA viruses, which is the computation result of MRPrimer using a supercomputer (Rank #454 in TOP500 Supercomputer, June 2016) for more than 2 weeks. MRPrimerW2 is an enhanced web-based online processing tool based on GPU computation. Lastly, I will introduce some of recent research results for detecting COVID-19 more precisely. location: Online(zoom) tag:csweb.calendar",
