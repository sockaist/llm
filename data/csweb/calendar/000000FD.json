Bio I’m an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zürich. I lead the Computer Vision and Learning Group (VLG) at the Institute of Visual Computing. Before joining ETH, I received an early career research grant to start my research group at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in November 2017. I was a postdoctoral researcher in the same institute, advised by Dr. Michael Black. I obtained my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in 2017, under the supervision of Professor Bernt Schiele. Before that, I obtained my Master’s degree in Media Informatics at RWTH Aachen University and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Zhejiang University, China.
