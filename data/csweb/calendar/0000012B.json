Ensuring robust and reliable autonomy is essential for realizing the era of truly autonomous driving. In this talk, I will share my thoughts on autonomy: What it is, why it matters, the challenges it faces, and the milestones in its development. Bio: Dr. Youngwoo Seo is a field-roboticist of building mobile robots including self-driving cars, drones, a high-speed transport – hyperloop, unmanned ground vehicles, etc. for more than two decades, and a seasoned executive with experience of managing diverse teams to deliver what matters. He currently serves as an Executive Vice President at the Land Systems Business Group, Hanwha Aerospace, where he oversees R&D efforts, among other responsibilities, for developing robotics and autonomous systems. Prior to joining Hanwha, Dr. Seo ran Atlas Robotics, Inc. to deliver a technology stack for autonomous mobility by shared autonomy, and led a team of engineers to develop perception stacks and mission-critical systems for Hyperloop One, to develop an autonomous flight stack for Autel Robotics, to deliver parts of the next-generation product at the Special Project Group of Apple, Inc., to deliver public demonstration of autonomous driving with GM-CMU Autonomous Driving Collaborative Research Lab. During his doctoral study, he was a member of the Tartan Racing team, the winning entry of the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, and worked on developing computational ways of augmenting cartographic resources and of assessing roadway status for reliable autonomous driving. While working as a research staff at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, he developed many machine learning algorithms and multi-agents systems to solve real-world problems. He earned a Ph.D. and a master’s degree in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, and a master’s degree in computer science from Seoul National University. location: E3-1 1501 (Offline) tag:csweb.calendar",
