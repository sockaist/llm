Title : Searching for Cost Effective Test Inputs for DNN Testing 5. Abstract : DNNs are a good example of the \"non-testable” programs, a concept proposed by Weyuker in the 80s. Due to the challenges in generating test oracles for them, many existing testing techniques for DNNs are based on the concept of metamorphic testing. An implication of this is that, unlike traditional programs, we can neither randomly sample nor search for inputs with specific properties, instead bound by pre-determined perturbations. This talk will look at some of the recent first steps in search based test data generation, which allows us to navigate the input space guided by Surprise Adequacy (SA). We will also look at how can be used to mitigate the program of manual labelling cost. 6. Bio : Shin Yoo is an associate professor in the School of Computing at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Republic of Korea. From 2012 to 2015, he was a lecturer of software engineering in Centre for Research on Evolution, Search, and Testing (CREST) at University College London, UK. He received PhD in Computer Science from King’s College London, UK, in 2009. He received MSc and BSc from King’s College London and Seoul National University, Korea, respectively. His main research interest lies in Search Based Software Engineering, i.e. the use of meta- heuristics and computational intelligence, such as genetic algorithm, to automatically solve various problems in software engineering, especially those related to testing and debugging. location: Online(zoom) tag:csweb.calendar",
