These bugs are often introduced by programmers when converting protocol descriptions into code. In this talk I will describe a new technique we have been developing to identify these bugs at runtime: Runtime Protocol Refinement Checking} (RPRC). RPRC systems observe a deployed service's runtime behavior and notify operators when this behavior evidences a protocol implementation bug, allowing operators to mitigate the bugs impact and developers to fix the bug. We have developed an algorithm for RPRC and implemented it in a system called Ellsberg that targets services that assume the asynchronous or partially synchronous model, and fail-stop failures. We designed Ellsberg so it makes no assumptions about how services are implemented, and requires no additional coordination or communication. We have used Ellsberg with three open source services: Etcd, Zookeeper and Redis Raft.
