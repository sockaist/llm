This trend indicates a shift towards extensive collaboration with LLMs, where humans delegate tasks to them while focusing on higher-level skills unique to their capabilities. However, haphazard pairing of humans and AIs can lead to negative consequences, such as blind trust in incorrect AI outputs and decreased human productivity. In this talk, I will discuss our effort in promoting effective human-AI collaboration, by ensuring competence in both humans and AIs for their respective responsibilities and enhancing their collaboration. I will cover three themes: (1) Evaluating LLMs on specific usage scenarios; (2) Building task-specific interactions that maximize LLM usabilities; and (3) Training and guiding humans to optimize their collaboration skills with AI systems. In my final remarks, I will reflect on how AI advances can be viewed through the lens of their usefulness to actual human users. Bio: Sherry Tongshuang Wu is an Assistant Professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Her research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing, and primarily focuses on how humans (AI experts, lay users, domain experts) can practically interact with (debug, audit, and collaborate with) AI systems. To this end, she has worked on assessing NLP model capabilities, supporting human-in-the-loop NLP model debugging and correction, as well as facilitating human-AI collaboration. She has authored award-winning papers in top-tier NLP, HCI and Visualization conferences and journals such as ACL, CHI, TOCHI, TVCG, etc. Before joining CMU, Sherry received her Ph.D. degree from the University of Washington and her bachelor degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and has interned at Microsoft Research, Google Research, and Apple.
