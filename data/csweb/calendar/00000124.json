Ackerman from the University of Michigan, School of Information will be joining as part of a workshop with the Phenomenal Data Lab at KAIST (https://phenomenaldatalab.kaist.ac.kr) on the topic of: “Beyond Gen AI: Sociotechnical AI Tools for Academic Literature Reviews”. He will be going over the basics of sociotechnical approaches to CSCW/HCI, and then early stage findings from the collaborative project will be presented and discussed as examples of how a sociotechnical approach is relevant for a Gen AI (or post-Gen AI) world. Students are especially encouraged to attend. Date and time: February 6 (Thursday) 1:30 PM-3:00 PM (KST) Location: N22 1st floor Room 103 (이민화홀) Language: English Host: Prof. Tom Steinberger [Main research seminar] Professor Mark S. Ackerman from the University of Michigan, School of Information will give an in-person talk on sociotechnical approaches to computing. Specifically, he will be reflecting on his several decades of research helping pioneer the sociotechnical study and design of making computing systems useful for humans and organizations, drawing lessons for future research.
