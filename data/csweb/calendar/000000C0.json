Title: Fairness, Transfer, and Explainability of AI in Education 4. Abstract : Data-driven predictive models could improve student outcomes and inequalities in schools and universities, but studies in other domains suggest instead that ML models tend to exacerbate existing inequities without added precautions. A growing body of research is beginning to map out where biases are likely to occur, what contributes to them, and how to mitigate them. These efforts to advance algorithmic fairness are an important research direction, but it is critical to also consider how AI systems are used in educational contexts to support decisions. I will present studies that highlight issues of algorithmic fairness, transfer learning, and explainability of AI systems in educational contexts, and explore the role of human factors in AI systems and their implications for advancing equity and inclusion in education. 5. Bio : Rene Kizilcec is an Assistant Professor of Information Science at Cornell University, where he directs the Future of Learning Lab. He studies the use and impact of technology in formal and informal learning environments (incl. college classes, online degree programs, mobile learning, professional development, MOOCs, and middle/high school classrooms) with behavioral, psychological, and computational science methods. His work on algorithmic fairness in education studies the implications of predictive models for equity and his research on scalable interventions to broaden participation and reduce achievement gaps has appeared in Science and PNAS. He served as general conference chair (2022) and program chair (2020) for ACM Learning at Scale. Kizilcec received a BA in Philosophy and Economics from University College London, and a MSc in Statistics and PhD in Communication from Stanford University. 6.
