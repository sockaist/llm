Moreover, the progress in statistical inference,, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence methodologies are transforming the power system operation and planning and turning utilities into data-driven enterprises. The Big Data Application in Power Systems book focuses on rapidly modernizing monitoring and analytical approaches to process the high dimensional, heterogeneous, and spatiotemporal data. This book discusses challenges, opportunities, success stories, and pathways for utilizing big data value in smart grids. Bio: Prof. Reza Arghandeh is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematical Sciences at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL), in Bergen, Norway. He is the director of the Collaborative Intelligent Infrastructure Lab (CI2Lab). He is also a senior data scientist at StormGeo company. He has been an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Florida State University, USA, 2015-2018. He completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Virginia Tech (2013) and spent two years as a post-doctorate fellow at the University of California-Berkeley. He also holds two master's degrees, one in Industrial & Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech (2013) and the other in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Manchester (2008).
