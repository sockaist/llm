This talk will be presented in Korean. 1. Date & Time: 14:00, August 23, 2022 2. Place: - Offline: Information & Electronics Building (E3-1) Room 4443 OSS Multimedia - Online: https://kaist.zoom.us/my/aliceatkaist 3. Speaker: Dongyeop Kang (Assistant professor, University of Minnesota) 4. Title: Human-centric NLP: Learning from human perceptions, interactions, and disagreements 5. Abstract: NLP systems trained in classical ML pipeline suffer from the lack of robustness, interpretability, and controllability. This talk will propose a human-centric NLP pipeline that allows the model to learn more from human perceptions, interactions with humans, and disagreements among diverse humans. 6. Bio: Dongyeop Kang (DK) is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Engineering department at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He leads the Minnesota Natural Language Processing (NLP) group that aims to develop human-centered language technologies. He completed a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, and obtained a Ph.D. in the Language Technologies Institute of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He has been recently awarded the 3M NTFA faculty award, Sony Research faculty award, and the best paper award by the In2Writing workshop at ACL 2022. His Ph.D. study was supported by the AI2 fellowship, CMU Presidential fellowship, and ILJU Ph.D. fellowship. 7.
