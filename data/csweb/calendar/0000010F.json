I will start from two fundamental questions: is it possible to infer a network’s neutrality based on external observations? is it possible to localise neutrality violations to specific network areas based on external observations? I will give the answers, then describe how we use them to reason about ISPs’ traditional traffic-differentiation practises (policing or shaping traffic from specific content providers). Then, I will argue that there is a more surreptitious (and more dangerous?) form of differentiation on the rise: in-network caching; and I will discuss whether caching — and the current Internet architecture, which relies heavily on it — is fundamentally incompatible with the concept of neutrality. I will close on a more fun note: how to improve Internet transparency by extracting thousands of Internet performance-metrics every day from public game-streaming footage. Bio Katerina is an associate professor of computer science at EPFL, where she does research on network architecture and systems, with a particular interest in network transparency and neutrality. She received an IRTF applied networking research prize (2020) and Best Paper awards at SOSP (2009) and NSDI (2014), all shared with her students and co-authors. She has been honored with the EuroSys Jochen Liedtke Young Researcher Award (2016) and three teaching awards at EPFL. Prior to EPFL, she worked at Arista Networks from day one, and received her PhD from Stanford (2007). location: 온라인 tag:csweb.calendar",
