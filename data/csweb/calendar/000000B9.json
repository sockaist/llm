Title: Efficient Transfer Learning with Large Language Models 3. Abstract: Transfer learning with large pretrained language models is the dominant paradigm in natural language processing. With moderately-sized models (e.g., BERT), transfer learning involves full finetuning to obtain a task-specific model with its own parameters for each task, which makes the approach hard to scale to storage-constrained scenarios. With larger models (e.g., GPT-3), the model is adapted to each task via natural language prompts and thus the pretrained parameters remain fixed. However, few-shot learning capabilities via prompting emerge only when model sizes are large enough, and thus inference remains expensive. This talk explores two approaches for improving the memory- and inference-efficiency of large language models within the transfer learning paradigm. For finetuned models, we show that only a small subset of the model parameters (0.5％) need to be updated to match the performance of fully-finetuned models. For prompted models, we show that co-training (wherein two models are trained on confidently-labeled outputs from each other) can produce much smaller models that outperform the original prompted model. 4.
