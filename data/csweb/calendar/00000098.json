I hope there is no mistake. Language : English Here is the talk's abstract and the speaker's short biography. Abstract Quantum computing is “the candidate” to overcome the physical limit of the current computing technology. The capacity increase of CPUs has started saturating during the last decade. Quantum computing is a totally new kind of computing technology that utilize quantum superposition and entanglement, which can offer million times more computing capacity, once we get an ideal quantum computing HW. Until then, there are going to be many technical advances to make use of the intermediate quantum computing technology, so called NISQ computing. This talk will provide the audience with fundamental understandings how quantum computer works, the recent development of NISQ machines and their application SW. As well, I will share my experience of starting a venture company. Bio - Professor in Electrical Engineering, KAIST - Director of KAIST Institute of ICT Convergence - CEO of Qunova Computing Dr. Rhee is a professor and entrepreneur specialized in quantum computing and quantum information. He has found and led the first university research center on quantum computing in Korea, or the ITRC of Quantum Computing for AI, with 9 other faculty members from 4 universities. The center published more than 80 technical papers and patents on qubit technologies and quantum application SW, which led to found a venture start-up, Qunova Computing, on quantum computing application software products. Professor Rhee is a graduate from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with Ph.D in electrical engineering.
