Bonn) Title: Anticipation: From Human Motion to Wildfires Time: 16:00 , April 8, 2024 Online Link: https://kaist.zoom.us/j/84101178320?pwd=QnRFVURYbTNNbFZ2ejBTRlB0NzNHdz09 - ID: 841 0117 8320 - PW: 150691 Language: English Here is the speaker's abstract and biography. Abstract In this talk, I will give an overview of some recent works on anticipating human motion. In particular, I will discuss Social Diffusion, a diffusion approach for short-term and long-term forecasting of the motion of multiple persons as well as their social interactions. I will also introduce the \"Humans in Kitchens\" dataset, a new benchmark for multi-person human motion forecasting with scene context. Finally, I will briefly describe an approach for forecasting unintentional actions and, if time permits, I will also discuss how wildfire and agricultural droughts can be forecast. Bio Prof. Dr. Juergen Gall is professor and head of the Computer Vision Group at the University of Bonn since 2013, spokesperson of the Transdisciplinary Research Area “Mathematics, Modelling and Simulation of Complex Systems”, and member of the Lamarr Institute for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. After his Ph.D. in computer science from the Saarland University and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, from 2009 until 2012 and senior research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen from 2012 until 2013. He received a grant for an independent Emmy Noether research group from the German Research Foundation (DFG) in 2013, the German Pattern Recognition Award of the German Association for Pattern Recognition (DAGM) in 2014, an ERC Starting Grant in 2016, and an ERC Consolidator Grant in 2022. He is further spokesperson of the DFG funded research unit “Anticipating Human Behavior” and PI of the Cluster of Excellence “PhenoRob – Robotics and Phenotyping for Sustainable Crop Production”.
