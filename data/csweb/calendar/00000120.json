Abstract The memory wall has long been recognized as a critical challenge in high-performance systems, and it has recently become even more significant due to the exponential growth of machine learning model sizes. Meanwhile, recent advancements in interconnect technology, such as Compute Express Link (CXL), enable scalable memory system designs to address the memory capacity wall. Moreover, by offloading data and computation to CXL memory expanders to realize Near-Data Processing (NDP), the memory bandwidth wall can also be effectively mitigated. However, designing such a system should be done carefully, considering various design aspects that can affect the practicality of the solution. In this talk, I will discuss key considerations and directions for building a practical NDP system architecture, including general-purpose computing, low-latency host communication, standard compliance, and cost-effectiveness. I will then present our recent work on an NDP architecture called Memory-Mapped NDP (M²NDP). M²NDP consists of two components: 1) Memory-Mapped Function (M²func), which enables low-latency host-device communication by addressing the overhead of conventional ring buffer-based task offloading, and 2) Memory-Mapped μthreading (M²μthread), a general-purpose, cost-effective NDP unit architecture that aims to maximize resource utilization by hybridizing CPU and GPU architectures. Finally, I will briefly outline future research directions based on the M²NDP architecture.
