Hence, there is a gap in our understanding regarding how individuals actively shape their emotional states through their choices of external stimuli. Detailed activity data generated from popular services like Spotify give us an exciting way to research the relationship between one such external stimulus —music— and affect. In this talk, I investigate diurnal and seasonal patterns of affective preference drawing on a dataset of 765 million online music plays streamed by 1 million individuals in 51 countries. I show that diurnal patterns are similar across cultures and demographic groups. Individuals listen to more relaxing music late at night and more energetic music during normal business hours, including mid-afternoon when affective expression hits bottom. I find, however, differences in baselines: younger people listen to more arousing music; compared with other regions, music played in Latin America is more arousing, while music in Asia is more relaxing; and compared with other chronotypes, ‘night owls’ (people who are habitually active or wakeful at night) listen to more relaxing music. Seasonal patterns vary with distance from the equator and between Northern and Southern hemispheres and are more strongly correlated with absolute day length than with changes in day length. Taken together with previous findings on affective expression in text, these results suggest that musical choice both shapes and reflects mood. Bio Minsu Park is a Research Fellow at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He is going to join NYU Abu Dhabi in Fall 2020 as an Assistant Professor of Sociology. He earned his Ph.D. in Information Science from Cornell University. He uses and develops computational methods to explore cultural consumption behaviors and their impact on social and social-psychological outcomes. His highly interdisciplinary research orientation is exemplified by publications not only in premier computer and information science conferences (e.g., ICWSM) but also in leading interdisciplinary journals (e.g., Nature Human Behaviour). His work has been covered in popular media such as Ars Technica and Fururity among others. location: Room 201, Building N1 tag:csweb.calendar",
