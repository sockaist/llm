It is becoming clearer, however, that AI capability is quickly hitting a plateau as there is a clear gap between the real world and the world that training data captures--i.e., The AI data bias. In this talk, we will discuss different types of AI data biases, how public and private sector entities should approach to overcome the bias, and how bias-free AI development can be achieved by real-world crowds. Short bio: Dr. Soohyun Bae is a co-founder and chief technology officer who oversees the overall technology at Bobidi. Most recently, he was an engineering leader on spatial mapping and data collection for Pokemon Go augmented reality. He previously co-founded TickTock AI for a single platform for AR and robotics, which was acquired by Niantic. Before then, he spent five years building planet-scale 3D maps at Google. He received MS and Ph.D. in information-theoretic machine learning from the Georgia Institute of Technology. He published over 20 papers, holds 9 US and international patents and supports multiple startups as an angel investor and technical advisor.
