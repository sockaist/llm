However, such interactions pose new challenges to traditional approaches to security and privacy. In this talk, I will present how I utilize sensor data to provide security and privacy protections for IoT/CPS scenarios, and further introduce novel security threats arising from similar sensor data. Specifically, I will highlight some of our recent projects that leverage sensor data for attack and defense in various IoT settings. I will also introduce my future research directions such as identifying and defending against unforeseen security challenges from newer domains including smart homes, buildings, and vehicles. Bio: Jun Han is an Associate Professor at KAIST of Computer Science, School of Computing at KAIST. He founded and directs the Cyber-Physical Systems and Security (CyPhy) Lab at KAIST. Prior to joining KAIST, he was at the National University of Singapore with an appointment in the Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, and Yonsei University with an appointment in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. His research interest lies at the intersection of security and mobile/sensing systems and focuses on utilizing contextual information to solve security problems in the Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. He publishes at top-tier venues across various research communities spanning mobile computing, sensing systems, and security (including IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, ACM CCS, MobiSys, MobiCom, SenSys, Ubicomp, IPSN). location: E3-1 1501 (Offline) tag:csweb.calendar",
