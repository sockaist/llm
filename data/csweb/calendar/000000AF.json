Title : Vision-and-Language Learning: Pretraining, Transfer Learning, and Evaluation 2. Abstract: Vision-and-Language learning is an emerging field to develop machine learning models that can handle both vision and language data. Mirroring the success in the natural language processing domain, large-scale pretraining followed by transfer learning has become the standard approach in this area. This talk will cover three recent works on vision-and-language learning: 1) how to tackle different vision-and-language tasks with a single unified pretrained model, 2) how to evaluate the pretrained text-to-image models, and 3) how to transfer knowledge from pretrained vision-and-language models. ＊1) Image ＋ Text: Unifying Vision-and-Language Tasks via Text Generation (ICML 2021) ＊2) Text -> Image: DALL-Eval: Probing the Reasoning Skills and Social Biases of Text-to-Image Generative Transformers (Arxiv 2022) ＊3) Image -> Text: Fine-grained Image Captioning with CLIP Reward (Findings of NAACL 2022; short) 3. Bio: Jaemin Cho is a PhD student at UNC Chapel Hill, working with his advisor Mohit Bansal. He is interested in multimodal machine learning to develop agents that understand various data types, such as language and vision. Before UNC, he worked at AI2, Naver, and SNU. Homepage: j-min.io 4. Language : Korean. Can be changed to English depending on the participants. We look forward to seeing many of you at the talk. location: nformation & Electronics Building (E3-1) Room #4443+https://kaist.zoom.us/my/aliceatkaist tag:csweb.calendar",
