Title : Programmable Reality: Making the World a Dynamic Medium through Visually and Physically Programmable Environments Speaker : Prof. Ryo Suzuki (University of Calgary) Host : Andrea Bianchi Abstract Today, a computational medium and its representations are trapped as “pictures under glass”---what we can program is only limited to virtual objects on screens, which we cannot touch, manipulate, and interact with, in the same way, we do with real objects in the real world. My research goal is to change this paradigm to make our whole living environment “a dynamic medium”---instead of confining ourselves to a flat rectangle screen, I envision a future where the world itself is an expressive canvas and dynamic physical medium, as if we are living in a computer, rather than living with it. For example, what if we could draw dynamic sketches that can be embedded and interact with the real physical environment? What if we could “render” an arbitrary physical shape, just like a 3D printer, but in a dynamic manner (i.e., render in seconds rather than hours)? What if our physical environments can transform and reconfigure themselves to provide haptic sensations or support our everyday life? In this talk, I illustrate this vision of “Programmable Reality”, which aims to blend pixels and atoms through both visually and physically programmable environments. By leveraging AR/VR, robotics, and shape-changing technologies, I show how we can transform and augment the world for the future of the dynamic medium. Then, I discuss open research challenges and opportunities to make this vision reality. Bio Ryo Suzuki ( http://ryosuzuki.org/ ) is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Calgary, where he directs the Programmable Reality Lab. Prior to joining UCalgary, he graduated from PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2020, where he was advised by Daniel Leithinger and Mark Gross. His research interest lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and robotics. He explores how we can combine AR/VR and robotics technologies to make our environments more dynamic, interactive, and programmable to further blend virtual and physical worlds. In the past 6 years, he has published more than twenty full-paper publications at top HCI and robotics venues, such as CHI, UIST, IROS, ICRA, and received three awarded papers. He has also served as a program committee member for CHI and UIST among others. Previously he also worked as a research intern at Stanford University, UC Berkeley, the University of Tokyo, Adobe Research, and Microsoft Research. location: Industrial Design Building N25 Woonbum Hall (1st floor) tag:csweb.calendar",
