More specifically, We newly introduce to the research communities the notion of large-scale wide-area ubiquitous services and are leading the research activities developing core infrastructures and technologies to realize them. While the proposed researches are academically novel and challenging, they are also highly practical and commercially valuable in diverse industries including telematics, ITS, LBS, entertainment, media and broadcasting, education, logistics, security, and most importantly ubiquitous city. The technologies will offer great chances to renovate many existing businesses and services, and further initiate many new ones.",
