Do you want to learn properly how to get started with JavaScript, web development, and Node.js but do not have much prior coding experience? Are you a designer who wants to build a portfolio with interactive programs? Then consider taking ID311 Software Prototyping this spring semester. This course is part of a series focused on prototyping: - Interaction Prototyping (ID220, offered in Fall) - Software Prototyping (ID311, offered in Spring) - AI Prototyping (offered in Fall) Overview This Software Prototyping (ID311) course offered in the Department of Industrial Design at KAIST aims to provide students with the theoretical and practical programming background to develop software for the web. Students who take this course should already be familiar with the basics of programming and are expected to spend considerable time during the semester programming short assignments and a final project. The course objectives are 1) to teach computational thinking through programming, 2) to familiarize students with the development environment and language for web applications (i.e., JavaScript), and 3) to practice with common programming paradigms such as Object-Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, and Event-Driven Programming.",
